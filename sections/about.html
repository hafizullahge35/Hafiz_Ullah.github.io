    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a geohazards engineer specializing in AI-assisted landslide susceptibility mapping,
      SAR-based ground deformation analysis, and geospatial modeling for risk assessment.
      My work integrates GIS/RS, Geo-AI, and civil/environmental engineering to improve hazard
      prediction accuracy and inform sustainable land-use and disaster risk reduction.
